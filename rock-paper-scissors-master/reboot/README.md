# Advanced - Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard & Spock

## Welcome! 👋

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this Rock, Paper, Scissors game and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Unfortunately, I was unable to compete the CSS portion of this project before my release date... so disappointing, I know.
I got the logic of the game working with my JavaScript and jQuery skills, used Bootstrap 5 to handle the majority of my layout design and the style guide to match the colors and backgrounds, etc.
I loved this assignment, it was so much better than the original project we did for week 13. With that in mind, I will add this to my portfolio page so that I can complete it on the other side of the fence next week.
Time, we either have too much, or not enough it seems...

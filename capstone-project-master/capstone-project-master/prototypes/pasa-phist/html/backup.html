          <h2>The Birth of an Anti-Hero</h2>
          <h5>Prologue</h5>
          <p>My so-called 'kinsman;' Wulfgar, son of Beornegar calls upon <em>Tempus</em> as the greatest of the gods,
            for that is the only god who answers to fools. I am no such fool. I have no use for these beings that skulk
            behind their paltry shields of <em>'honor'</em> &amp; <em>'glory'...</em></p>
          <h4><strong><em>&iexcl;&iquest;Honor&quest;&excl;</em></strong></h4>
          <p>Was it honor that compelled my mother's tribe of Wilderkin elves to abandon her half-blood babe to the icy
            disregard of the tundra, still steaming in her lifeblood from the birthing bed? Casting a helpless infant to
            the cold embrace of fate while her corpse slowly chills the last bed she would ever be lain in. Let the babe
            die with the dam, and damn the man who begot such a mangy cur! What glorious honor indeed!</p>
          <h4><strong><em>&iexcl;&iquest;Glory&quest;&excl;</em></strong></h4>
          <p>Was it for said glory that my adopted <em>Tribe of the Elk</em> decided to take in a half-dead foundling,
            only to shun the child as an outcast when its half-blooded heritage began to show through? Wulfgar can
            associate with all manner of beings with impunity, even going as far as to be adopted, not once- but twice!-
            by a dirt-grubbing dwarven exile, but because that dwarf is some fabled king of a forgotten realm, then
            <em>Tempus must have willed it so!</em> Yet this same god demands my station to be that of some lower caste,
            sub-human being, barely worth the effort to scorn, let alone be trained in the arts of war and glory like
            his peers... where is his vaulted godly justice, I ask?</p>
          <p>Even my naming smacks of dishonor... with every syllable, an endowment that implies passivity, a pun for
            predetermined weakness, given to a child in ignorance of any future potential and without disregard as to
            the power of a simple name. To be forever branded as lesser, incapable of ever rising above my current
            station, to be forever shunned or ridiculed, is this is the honorable fate that has been gloriously bestowed
            upon my unwilling shoulders... I think not.</p>
          <p>Instead, I say unto thee; to the Nine Hells with your paltry god and is so-called glories! Half-Elven I may
            be, but half-barbarian I also be, for do I not feel the <strong><em>Rage</em></strong> course through my
            veins as well&quest; Does the power not crackle through my blood as I heed the berserker call to battle like
            all my peers&quest; Does the lust for battle not sing in my heart as well&quest; Of course it does, so I
            followed that siren song far to the north, where the Endless Sea of Ice calls to me. Where the fires of
            heavenly battles race across the sky at night and the winds of change blow every which way. Only where the
            fire burns brightest was I able to reforge my very soul, for out in the endless white, I called out to my
            god... <strong><br><em>And.<br>My.<br>God.<br>Answered!</em></strong></p>
          <h4>To the Nine Hells with <em>Tempus</em>, for my god is the one true god, my god is
            <strong>&iexcl;Talos&excl;</strong> and <strong>He</strong> is the only god I know.</h4>

            <h5>Travel Log - Part One</h5>
            <p><b>Day One:</b> Left behind the sniveling shaman from the Tribe of the Elk to seek inspiration on my own
              from the tundra. I will not be missed. The feeling is mutual.</p>
            <p><b>Day Five:</b> Found... <i>&iquest;guidance&quest;</i> ...Had a somewhat amusing encounter during my
              spirit quest while skirting the edge of the Sea of Moving Ice. Must rest and consider these revelations...
            </p>
            <p><b>Day Six:</b> It seems a worthy god has chosen to favor me. I have been instructed by my new liege,
              <b>Talos</b>, to seek out the citadel of <b>Nightspire</b>, located somewhere far to the south in the
              <b>Silver Marches</b>. I am told my path to power lies that way...</p>
            <p><b>Day Nine:</b> The Lord of Storms is fickle indeed. I have been trapped for days by this vicious storm,
              unable to continue my journey south. My frustration grows ever deeper as the snow piles upon my shelter.
            </p>
            <p><b>Day Thirteen:</b> I am nearly out of supplies, and Ten-Towns is easily still another day away... I
              struggle to make any sort of headway, yet my hunger distracts me constantly. I must forage and remedy my
              depleted stores if I am to continue.</p>
            <p><b>Day Sixteen:</b> Tundra yeti tastes even worse than I imagined. Hopefully I can continue on without
              encountering any other disgusting humanoids...</p>

          <h2>Idle Hands</h2>

          <ol class="logbook">
            <h5>Travel Log - Part Two</h5>
            <p><b>Day Twenty:</b></p>
            <p>Today was a peculiar day. On the final leg of my journey towards Ten-Towns, I encountered what was most
              certainly an old codger with a death wish... So I obliged. Then, inspiration struck as I struck his head
              from his shoulders, so I offered his severed head to my newfound god. Judging from the thunderous
              lightning bolt that came from a clear sky to incinerate the polar bear I was unaware of stalking me, I
              would say <b>Talos</b> is pleased with the offering. Not only do I have a fine cache of divinely cooked
              bear meat, I also managed to gain some fine loot from the old codgers corpse... I guess it does pay to
              help a stranger now &amp; then, especially if they are seeking their own death.</p>
            <p><b>Day Twenty-One:</b></p>
            <p>It seems I was delayed just enough by the storm to miss the last caravan headed south for the season...
              of course. Now I find myself stuck here at Lonelywood with few options and far too much time ahead of me.
              I have at least 14 ten-days to wait before the first caravan will be ready to travel again. Damn it all to
              the Nine Hells... it looks like I may have to do the unthinkable. I may have to go looking for a job.</p>
            <p><b>Day Twenty-Three:</b></p>
            <p>The shame of it all... it seems if I hope to ever make more than the bare minimum needed to scrape by in
              this miserable pit, I am going to have to buy some better quality tools. So, I must go into debt to buy
              the tools I require to work my way out of said debt incured obtaining a job... civilization makes no sense
              whatsoever.</p>

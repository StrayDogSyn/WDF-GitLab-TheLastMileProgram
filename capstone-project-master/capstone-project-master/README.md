>> Unfortunately, I am leaving prison before completing this assignment. But this is a project I have been working on since the very first day I was handed my Chromebook. Stay tuned for the completed version, I plan on finishing this   application by the end of the year and possibly porting it into the Unity programming language to make it available for the SCORE7 tablets used in most correctional facilities. I have put a tremendous amount of thought into this project, and even though it is incomplete at the moment, I will be continuing to develop my application on the other side of the fence.
